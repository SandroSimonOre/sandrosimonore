# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Sandro SimÃ³n, from Lima, PerÃº. I have worked in accounting for almost twenty years.

Currently I am making a career change. I would love to work as a web developer.

Technologies I have studied include: JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GitHub among others.

## My projects
### API Consumption
An app to explore trending movies, by categories, search and save as favorites in the local browser.
A live version can be found here:

### Personal WebSite
 It has been built with HTML, Sass and Javascript. Media queries were used to make it possible to view it on a SmartPhone. The website is available in Spanish and English. It can be found here:
